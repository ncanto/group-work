**Homework**

The "Homework" folder contains the homework assignments for weeks 1-6 of the course, i.e. the midterm assignment.


**Final-project:** 

How do cryptocurrency exchange rates react to Fed rate changes?

For our final project, we will investigate the impact of Federal Reserve interest rate changes on the exchange rates of various cryptocurrencies. The study will cover a time span of five years and utilize an API from COINLAYER or another reputable source to collect data on a basket of cryptocurrencies, including the original cryptocurrencies (e.g. ETH, BTC), an index, and Layer 1 cryptocurrencies (e.g. Luna, Matic). In addition to analyzing the exchange rates, we will also examine metrics such as volatility and correlation to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying trends and patterns in the cryptocurrency market.

**Limitations:**

One major limitation is the availability of data, as cryptocurrencies are a relatively new phenomenon and it can be challenging to obtain data for currencies that are older than five years. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in cleaning missing values for some cryptocurrencies and interest rates, as they are reported only on certain dates. These limitations may impact the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our findings.

The purpose of this course is to provide a fundamental understanding of various digital tools that can be utilized for collaboration and real-life research projects. In order to fully benefit from the lectures, we will strive to incorporate as many concepts and techniques as possible into our work. By doing so, we hope to gain a comprehensive and practical understanding of the tools and methods discussed in class.
