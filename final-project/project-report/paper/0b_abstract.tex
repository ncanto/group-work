This paper investigates the tie between the risk free rate (approximated by the 10 year treasury yield) and the returns of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Etherium, XRP and Litecoin, as well as the cryptocurrency market (approximated by CMC Crypto 200 Index by Solactive). For this purpose a data set is created using the yahoo API. The paper finds weak covariance and neglegible correlation. It is to conclude, that the cryptocurrency returns are not related to spikes in the risk free rate.
