In the previous sections we analyzed our data set to find a potential tie between the  10 year treasury yield and the return of various cryptocurrencies. We find a close-to-zero covariance and a neglibile correlation of the risk-free rate and the returns of Bitcoin, Etherium, XRP and Litecoin. The same holds for the relation of the bond to the cryptocurrency market, approximated by the CMC Crypto 200 Index. We conclude that there is no significant correlation between hikes in the risk-free rate and cryptocurrency returns.
