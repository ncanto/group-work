In the previous sections, we conducted an analysis of our dataset to examine the potential relationship between the 10-year treasury yield and the returns of various cryptocurrencies. Our findings indicate that there is a close-to-zero covariance and a negligible correlation between the risk-free rate and the returns of Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin. The same holds true for the relationship between the bond yield and the overall cryptocurrency market, as approximated by the CMC Crypto 200 Index. Based on these results, we conclude that there is no significant correlation between increases in the risk-free rate and cryptocurrency returns.
